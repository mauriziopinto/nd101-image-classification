## Image classification

# Introduction

In this project, I classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset have been preprocessed, then I trained a convolutional neural network on all the samples. I normalized the images, one-hot encoded the labels, built a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. 

At then end, I obtained the following accuracy:

* 0.6072850318471338

The accuracy can be largely improved with a more complex network architecture and more training.
